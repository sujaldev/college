        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Create an array of integer with size $n$.
            Return the difference between the largest and the smallest value inside that array.
            \item Initializes an array with ten random integers and then prints four lines of output, containing: Every
            element at an even index, Every odd element, All elements in reverse order, Only the first and last element.
            \item Consider an integer array of size 5 and display the following: Sum of all the elements, Sum of
            alternate elements in the array, and second-highest element in the array.
